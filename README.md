## Instructions
Add a burger to the menu by typing in the name of your burger in the input field and click "Add Burger". The burger will be added to the database and will appear in the table on the left hand side of the screen. "Eat" the burger by clicking on the "Devour It!" button right next to the name of the burger. The burger will then be added to the "Burgers you have eaten" table. That's it!
